## __2. About Me__

### Education
I'm currently in my junior year at the University of Washington, Tacoma. I'm working toward
my B.A. in Computer Science and Systems.
<br>

### Career Goals
I would like to be on a team that tackles complex and interesting problems. Challenge is what
makes life interesting. 
<br>

### What Motivates Me
I've had an interest in computers since I was 14 years old and received my first laptop as a
christmas gift. Since then its only grown. Every opportunity I've had to learn more about how
to use not just personal computers, but all technology, is very exciting for me. I currently
work in the sound industry, and I love going to work because I get to learn more about what I'm
working with and often find interesting solutions to complicated problems. I just want to learn
as much as I can.
<br>

### Hobbies and Interests
One of my more fun hobbies is building interactive systems for an online roleplaying game. This is
interesting to me because I'm essentially building rules for how players get to interact with the
world. Beyond the logic of building the systems I've started to code implementation for these systems
to add interaction beyond just written rules.
<br>
A while back I created a character builder in google sheets and I plan on using that as a basis for
creating a more professional version of it using Javascript and React.

## __3. Projects: This is Work in Progress (WIP)__
<br>

### __Character Point Calculator__
Technologies Used: Google Sheets Functions, Google Apps Script
<br>

<br>

Challenges and Key Learnings:
<br>
I did this project over my 2024 winter break. It was a lot of fun because I had a decent amount
of time to just sit down and learn google sheet functions and when those failed I was able to teach
myself how to write what I needed in Apps Script. It was more work than I expected to connect each
individual piece of the system. I'm still maintaining this project as the system updates, but I'm
hoping to start on a better version using react. 
<br>

Nothing more yet! But check back soon, because I'm sure this section is going
to be filled to the brim with new and interesting projects!

### Autumn 2024 TCSS 142 Hackathon
During my initial intro to Java class my professor decided as a fun extra credit
opportunity we would hold a hackathon for all the 142 classes at the school. My
team won first place. My role was reading the questions and using psuedo code to
develop a system for implementing the desired outcome. I communicated with my team
to ensure that we could collaborate on a solution that we all agreed on.
